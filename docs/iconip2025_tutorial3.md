## Description and Outline

### 3-1. Population Analysis of Large-Scale Human MRI Datasets  
**Speaker:** Saori Tanaka (ATR / NAIST)

This session will cover techniques for extracting population-level brain features from large-scale MRI datasets, including preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and population inference using machine learning.

1. Introduction to Large-Scale Human MRI Datasets  
2. Dataset Overview  
3. Preprocessing Pipeline  
4. Statistical Analysis and Visualization
5. Hands-on

### 3-2. Human Brain Dynamics via Multi-Modal Integration and Machine Learning 
**Speaker:** Dr. Okito Yamashita (ATR / RIKEN AIP)

This session will explore methods for analyzing human brain dynamics by integrating multiple neuroimaging modalities (e.g., fMRI, MEG) using advanced machine learning techniques. More specifically, the MEG/EEG current source imaging method using the Bayesian learning will be introduced.

1. Intoduction to MEG/EEG current source imaging
2. Foward modeling
3. Inverse modeling
4. Applications
5. Hands-on

### 3-3. Modeling Human Brain Activity with Generative AI  
**Speaker:** Yu Takagi (Nagoya Institute of Technology)

This session will introduce the neural encoding model as a method for identifying alignment between the latent representations of Generative AI and human brain activity.

1. Introduction to modeling brain data with Generative AI
2. Hands‑on session: modeling neural data while watching visual images

## Target Audience

This tutorial is intended for researchers interested in applying AI techniques to human brain imaging data such as MRI and MEG. It is particularly suited for those who wish to perform AI-based analyses using publicly available open neuroimaging datasets or their own recorded data. 

No prior experience with neuroimaging analysis is required. Sample brain data will be provided in advance for hands-on demonstrations. For Session 3-2, access to a MATLAB license is recommended for smoother participation.

Dr. Saori Tanaka began her research career in 2001 as a graduate student in computational neuroscience at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST). Her early work contributed foundational computational models of human decision-making, particularly in the area of temporal discounting. Her 2004 publication in Nature Neuroscience on this topic has been cited over 1,000 times and has had a significant impact on the development of the field. In recognition of this achievement, she received the Best Paper Award, Best Research Award, and Encouragement Award from the Japan Neural Networks Society in 2005.

As data science rapidly advanced, Dr. Tanaka became increasingly interested in integrating hypothesis-driven and data-driven approaches. In recent years, she has played a leading role in several national neuroscience flagship projects funded by MEXT and AMED. In particular, she has spearheaded the construction of open-access MRI data repositories comprising thousands of patients with brain disorders (Tanaka et al., 2022, Scientific Data). Recognizing the need for improved infrastructure and policy, she has actively advocated for enhanced data-sharing practices in Japan.
