## Short Bio
I began my research as a graduate student in computational neuroscience at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) in 2001. My early research established some of the first foundational computational models of decision-making, in particular my work on temporal discounting (Nature Neuroscience, 2004) has been cited >1000 times. and has had substantial impact on the development of the field. I received the Best Paper Award, Best Research Award, and Encouragement Award from the Japan Neural Networks Society in 2005 for this achievement. After completing graduate school, I continued my research on human decision-making and received the Nakayama Award for Encouragement from the Nakayama Science Foundation in 2008 for the theme of "Science of Emotion”.
With advances in data science, however, I became interested in fusing hypothesis-driven with data- driven approaches. Hence more recently, I have been involved in national flagship neuroscience projects funded by MEXT and AMED by leading in building databases to make MRI data from thousands of patients with human diseases publicly available (Tanaka et al., 2022, Scientific Data). Compared to other countries, Japan lags behind in data sharing, and there is an urgent need to improve policies and systems, and to secure human resources. I am now recognised as a leader of open science in the field of brain imaging in Japan, thanks to my expertise and skills in computational neuroscience, as well as the networks I have built with overseas researchers through invitations to several meetings of the International Brain Initiative (IBI).
In parallel with my research activities, I have actively contributed to developing the research field as a program committee member of various academic societies. As a representative of our society, I am also a member of the Future Plan Committee of the Japanese Association of Brain Science Societies, which consists of 19 basic and clinical brain science-related societies in Japan, and I have made proposals to the government, the public, and academic societies on future plans for brain science research. Specifically, I proposed the application of artificial intelligence technology and databases as essential areas of neuroscience in Japan's science policy.
